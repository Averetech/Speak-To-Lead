          exists to tell you more about organizations that teach public speaking
          and leadership skills. These are great skills that are needed across
          different industries and I highly recommend anyone that would like to
          improve in them to join Toastmasters International. Toastmasters
          International is a non-profit organization that helps people develop
          communication, public speaking, and leadership skills through a
          worldwide network of clubs that meet online and in person.

        <p class="about-TM">
          It has been a year since my first club meeting. After eight speeches
          and near-perfect monthly meeting attendance, I would like to say this
          is an amazing organization. Toastmasters brings a lot of value to
          someone <strong>new</strong> to public speaking and that is probably
          why it gained so much popularity online. The clubs offer an extremely
          friendly and safe environment for you to practice and fail, without
          having to worry about harsh judgement and career consequences.
